**ðŸ§  Skill Level Interpretation**
Proficiency levels in this dashboard are subjective and reflect my comfort and confidence with each skill, based on both coursework and hands-on practice. The scale is interpreted as follows:

* 10â€“30% â€” Beginner
Iâ€™ve just started learning the topic and have only a basic understanding. I may struggle to apply it without step-by-step guidance.
* 40â€“60% â€” Intermediate / Learning in Practice
I can use this skill with support from documentation or external resources. I understand the core concepts but still rely on checking things regularly.
* 70â€“80% â€” Confident User
I apply this skill independently in various contexts. I rarely need help and can solve standard tasks without looking things up.
* 85â€“95% â€” Advanced
Iâ€™m confident, efficient, and able to explain the topic to others. I can anticipate issues and debug effectively.
